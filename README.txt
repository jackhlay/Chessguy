Hello!

Thank you for your interest in my Chess Engine. all progress is on this branch.
This project is written in python.

Here are the milestones:
Surpassed:

Display a board
Display and center pieces
Write a function to parse the FEN
Once parced translate the space's info to the space
Be able to correctly output any FEN string
Turn Ordering
Double Buffering
En Passant
Castling
Pawn Promotion (no underpromotion yet)

Working on now:
Move Legality


Working on next:
Threefold repetition draw
Let the computer make moves
Allow the computer to explore depths without affecting the real board
Using this, LET HIM (the computer) COOK and find the best move.
Probably rewrite in C# after a while

Stretch milestones:

Maybe integrate into my website
