Hello!

Thank you for your interest in my Chess Engine. all progress is on the "Front-End-Era" branch.
This project is being reworked.
Previously it was pure python, but now i'm moving to a Java front end with python back end.

Here are the milestones:
Surpassed:
Working on now:

Display a board
Display and center pieces
Write a function to parse the FEN
Once parced translate the space's info to the space
Be able to correctly output any FEN string
Turn Ordering
Double Buffering
Move Legality
Working on next:
Let the computer make moves
Write rules for how each piece moves
Write rules for move legality
Allow the computer to explore depths without affecting the real board
Using this, LET HIM (the computer) COOK and find the best move.

Stretch milestones:
Build in network capabilities that allow for two people to play each other
Maybe integrate into my website
