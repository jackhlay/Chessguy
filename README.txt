Hello!

Thank you for your interest in my Chess Engine. This is the main branch so it will be more sparse than current, all progress is on the branch "Progress Tube". Have a look there for the most recent updates.
This project is written in python.

Here are the milestones:


Surpassed:

Display a board
Display and center pieces
Write a function to parse the FEN
Once parced translate the space's info to the space
Be able to correctly output any FEN string

Working on now:
Allow the ability to make moves

Working on next:

Allow the ability to make moves
Let the computer make moves
Write rules for how each piece moves
Write rules for move legality
Allow the computer to explore depths without affecting the real board
Using this, LET HIM (the computer) COOK and find the best move.

Stretch milestones:
Build in network capabilities that allow for two people to play each other
Maybe integrate into my website
