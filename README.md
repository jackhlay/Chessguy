# Hello!

### Thank you for your interest in my Chess Engine. As it stands, the Python file included here serves as a prototype or proof of concept. While the project is currently on hold, my plan is to transition to a Go backend-style engine for compatibility with standard chess GUIs like Arena once I return.

-==========================================================================-  

**Current Milestones:**

- Display a board
- Center pieces on the board
- Parse FEN notation
- Translate space information to the board
- Output any FEN string accurately
- Implement turn ordering
- Generate legal moves
- Enable the computer to explore depths without affecting the real board
- Implement iterative move calculation 

**In Progress:**

- Transitioning to GoLang + UCI format

**Next Steps:**

- Enable the engine to make moves (UCI solves this)
  
**Stretch Milestones:**

- Incorporate network capabilities for two-player gameplay
- Potentially integrate into my website
