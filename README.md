# Hello!

### Thank you for your interest in my Chess Engine. most current progress is held in this branch.

  
# This branch is once again the maintained branch!
## After a short stint making a java gui, I've decided to continue with this branch, starting with cleaning up the gui and how it work. Next i have to rework the move generation, and check if I have the rules implemented correctly.  

Here are the milestones:

**Surpassed:**
- Display a board
- Display and center pieces
- Write a function to parse the FEN
- Once parsed, translate the space's info to the space
- Be able to correctly output any FEN string
- Turn Ordering

**Working on now:**
- Move Generation

**Working on next:**
- Move legality
- Let the computer make moves
- Write rules for how each piece moves
- Write rules for move legality
- Allow the computer to explore depths without affecting the real board
- Using this, LET HIM (the computer) COOK and find the best move.

**Stretch milestones:**
- Build in network capabilities that allow for two people to play each other
- Maybe integrate into my website.
