# Hello!

### Thank you for your interest in my Chess Engine. all progress is on the Front-End-Era branch.  

  
# This branch is no longer maintained!
### This project was built on python to begin with, and it made a useable prototype, but not much more. It was kinda awkward, and relied on weird methods for various calculations including move calculation, and input. I hope to make a more polished product, using Java for the Front End, and python solely for positional analysis if possible.
