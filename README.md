# Hello!

### Thank you for your interest in my Chess Engine. As it stande, the python file contained here only serves as a prototype or proof of concept. This project is on the back burner for a second, but once I come back to it, I am going to continue moving to a go backend style engine to interact with standard chess guis like Arena, etc.  

-=============================================================================-  
Here are the milestones:

**Surpassed:**
- Display a board
- Display and center pieces
- Write a function to parse the FEN
- Once parsed, translate the space's info to the space
- Be able to correctly output any FEN string
- Turn Ordering
- Move Generation
- Move legality
- Allow the computer to explore depths without affecting the real board
- Iterative move calculation 

**Working on now:**
- Translating to GoLang + UCI format

**Working on next:**
- Let the computer make moves
  
**Stretch milestones:**
- Build in network capabilities that allow for two people to play each other
- Maybe integrate into my website.  

As always, contact info is at [jackhlay.com](https://jackhlay.com).
