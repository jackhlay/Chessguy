# Hello!

### Thank you for your interest in my Chess Engine. most current progress is held in the "Progress-Tube" branch.

### This is an experimental branch, where I am trying to move the engine to Go. I think python worked well as a prototype but the way i wrote it is so messy and wrong that I think I should do it right now that there's a working concept.

<!-- Here are the milestones:

**Surpassed:**
- Display a board
- Display and center pieces
- Write a function to parse the FEN
- Once parsed, translate the space's info to the space
- Be able to correctly output any FEN string
- Turn Ordering
- Move Generation
- Move legality

**Working on now:**
- Vectorizing

**Working on next:**
- Let the computer make moves
- Allow the computer to explore depths without affecting the real board

  
**Stretch milestones:**
- Build in network capabilities that allow for two people to play each other
- Maybe integrate into my website.   -->
